# hello-world
my first repository

This is me learning GitHub.

I want to change careers into coding/web development.

I'm learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm also interested in Ruby, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Meteor.js
  
Oh, yea.. I'm 30 years old and a case manager for youth at a non-profit in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. I'm also a freelance photographer.
